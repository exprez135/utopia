The world-wide and human-less utopia which I would create, if given the opportunity, would help lead to the rise of the Utopian Animal Empire, would protect the world's natural ecosystems from irreversible damage and destruction, and would end the destructive practices and conditions of human society. In fact, the only way to create an actual utopia is to rid it of human kind. Throughout history, any attempt to make a utopia has resulted in failure because of the greed of human leaders,the racism of the human people, and other human characteristics, which simply do not exist in animals. Thus, Animalism and the rise of the Utopian Animal Empire is the sole method of creating a utopia on Earth.
