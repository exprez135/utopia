The third reason for a human-less world-wide utopia is that it would allow for the rise of the Utopian Animal Empire. Without human interaction, many animals are able to thrive and live in utopia-like conditions. The Empire would be run by a council of three animals, each one the Monarch of their respective Kingdoms. The Empire would consist of the Five Animal Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Earth, the Kingdom of the Atmosphere, and the Marine Kingdom. Each Kingdom has three branches, the Executive Branch, the Legislative Branch, and the Judicial Branch. The Executive Branch of the Kingdoms consist of the Monarch, his Cabinet, an Executive Committee consisting of three elected animals, and the Federal agnecies and departments. An Executive Committee has the authority to override any decision made by the Monarch with a 2/3 super majority. The Legislative Branch consists of the Senate, and Parliament. The Senate consists of one representative from each Genus in their respective Kingdoms. Parliament consists of one representative for every one hundred tons that a genus weighs. The Judiciary Branch is headed by the Cardinal Court (Supreme Court), auxiliary to it are the Appellate COurts of Animalism, and under that are the Courts of Animalism. This system, full of sincere and perfect animals, would create the perfect utopia: the Utopian Animal Empire.
