The first advantage of my human-less world-wide utopia would be the end of many of human society's problems such as poverty, warfare, hunger, and disease. The first issue of human society which would be rectified is poverty. Throughout history, humanity has been a race of classes, the kings, the nobles, the peasants, the slaves. With all humans dead, every single one would be entirely equal in one everlasting class, death. The second major problem which would be solved is warfare. There has never been a single year in human history in which two nations, or tribes, or clans were fighting bloodly in war. In the twentieth century alone, at least 108 million people have died because of war. The third issue to be solved is hunger. Over ten percent of the entire world population is crtically malnourished, and require immediate attention. The fourth dilemna that would be solved is disease. Disease is the largest killer of humans there has ever been.  Millions and millions of people die each year, often in pain, from diseases such as heart disease, ebola, and cholera. With these issues and problems gone, billions of humans would be done with the misery and pain of disease, poverty, hunger, and warfare.
