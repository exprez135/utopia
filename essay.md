The second advantage of creating a human-less utopia is the survival of Earth's precious ecosystems. In today's world, humans are destroying forests, marine reefs, swamps, rivers, entire oceans, and many other biomes and ecosystems with pollution, overhunting, deforestation, and land conversion. At today's rate of deforestation (with no increase in the rate though that is likely), within one hundred years, Earth will have no more rainforests. Every second, one and a half acres of forest is cut down. That leaves only 33 percent of wild forests left. The current loss of forests contributes to between twelve and seventeen percent of anual global greenhouse gas emissions. Twenty-eight percent of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed. They are being destroyed at twice the rate of rainforests. Rivers and oceans are being polluted with oil, plastic, and other materials which are killing fish and other species. By 2048, from overfishing and pollution, there will be no more seafood. The damage being done to Earth by humans is incomprehensible and needs to be stopped at all costs, even if that means the death of seven billion humans.
