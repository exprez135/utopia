	Lois Lowry, author of The Giver, once wrote that a utopia was “The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without colour, pain or past.” For if any of these were untrue, the utopia could not exist. Yet, each of these characteristics is entirely engrained in human nature. Thus, the sole method of creating a utopia: getting rid of humans. In my world-wide utopia, humans would disappear, which would rid the world of society's human problems, protect Earth's ecosystems' from destruction, and allow for an utopian Animal Empire to rise.
